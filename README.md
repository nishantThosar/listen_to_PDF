**This program is tested on Windows 10 OS**

**Automatically:**
1. Install Python 3.x if not already installed.
2. Open a terminal in the program's folder.
3. Execute the program:
   python3 pdf_to_speech_ver_2.3.py

   **The program will automatically resolve its dependencies**
   
If the dependencies are not resolved automatically then go for the manual way.

**Manually:**
1. Install Python 3.x if not already installed.
2. Open a terminal in the program's folder.
3. Run the following command to install dependencies:
   python3 -m pip install -r requirements.txt
4. Execute the program:
   python3 pdf_to_speech_ver_2.3.py

This program is tested for 29-page PDF documents and is meant for PDF document use only.
Also, this program will take time if more pages are there (It's like the greater no of pages in PDF greater the conversion time) though it depends on your system also.
